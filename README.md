## Project Title & Short Description

**Project Title:** MediServe: Community Health Portal  

**Short Description:**  
The MediServe project aims to address inefficiencies and challenges faced by barangay residents and local health center staff in accessing and managing medical services. This platform transforms manual processes into a convenient, centralized digital system.

**Current Problem:**  
Residents ‚Äî especially the elderly and PWDs ‚Äî must physically visit health centers to check medicine availability, which is time-consuming and inconvenient. Manual tracking also causes delays, errors, and inaccurate records.

**MediServe Solution:**  
MediServe provides a centralized portal to improve healthcare delivery by allowing residents to check medicine inventory and health news online, while empowering medical staff with efficient tools for inventory, orders, and data management.
